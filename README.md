### My Capstone Project for Database Engineer Course Meta. 

A company called Little Lemon needs to build a robust relational database system in MySQL in which they can store large amounts of data. Where they can easily manage and find their data as required.

I will be building a database model using MySQL Workbench that contains the following tables:
1. **Bookings Table**: To store information about booked tables in the restaurant including booking id, date and table number.

2. **Orders Table**: To store information about each order such as order date, quantity and total cost.

3. **Delivery Table**: To store information about the delivery status of each order such as delivery date and status.

4. **Menu Table**: To store information about cuisines, starters, courses, drinks and desserts.

5. **Customer Table**: To store information about the customer names and contact details.

6. **Staff information**: Including role and salary.
